        <p style ="color: #E0FFFF">
            I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics Electronics from the Physics Department of the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria. During my undergraduate studies, I completed an industrial training program at Atopet Automation, where I learned technologies such as C++ and Arduino IDE for microcontroller programming. This experience culminated in my final year mini-project, "A Laser Security System for Underwater and Maritime Applications."

            In addition to my cybersecurity expertise, I possess advanced skills in Python, which I utilize for writing, modifying, and deploying automated scripts. My journey in Python for Penetration Testing has enabled me to undertake various projects related to ethical hacking, demonstrating my proficiency and dedication to this field.

        <p style ="color: #E0FFFF" >
            I have extensive experience with penetration testing tools such as Nmap and the Metasploit Framework. My work with these tools adheres to the Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES), ensuring thorough and systematic security assessments. I am continuously expanding my knowledge and skills, and I am committed to covering more advanced topics as my career progresses.
